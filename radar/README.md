First,you should open the arduino_radar.ino 

Modify the code based on the pins you are using.

![](https://github.com/Elecrow-RD/short_eletronics/blob/main/radar/README/1.png)

and upload the code to the Arduino UNO.

And then,  connect the Arduino UNO to ur computer.

Finaly, u should download the proccessing, and open the arduino_radar_processing_code.pde

Modify this section based on the serial port number you are using after connecting your Arduino UNO to the computer.
